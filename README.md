# ShlopApp

A modular e-commerce backend built with **Spring Boot**, designed using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and a **Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture** approach.

ShlopApp is a learning-focused commerce platform exploring how to build a scalable backend by separating business logic from infrastructure concerns.

---

## Overview

ShlopApp models an online shopping system with independent business modules (bounded contexts), including:

* Product catalog management
* Product variants
* Shopping cart management
* Identity and user management
* Order processing (planned)

The project follows a modular monolith approach, allowing each domain area to evolve independently while remaining within a single deployable application.

---

## Architecture

The application is organized around bounded contexts:

```
com.example.ShlopApp

├── Catalog
│   ├── Domain
│   ├── Application
│   ├── Infrastructure
│   └── Presentation
│
├── Cart
│   ├── Domain
│   ├── Application
│   ├── Infrastructure
│   └── Presentation
│
├── Identity
│   ├── Domain
│   ├── Application
│   ├── Infrastructure
│   └── Presentation
│
└── Ordering
    └── (planned)
```

Each module follows a layered design:

```
Presentation
      |
Application
      |
Domain
      |
Infrastructure
```

### Domain Layer

Contains business rules and core models:

* Aggregates
* Entities
* Value Objects
* Domain services
* Repository ports

The domain layer does not depend on frameworks or databases.

---

### Application Layer

Coordinates business operations through use cases.

Examples:

* Create cart
* Add item to cart
* Retrieve products
* Update cart contents

Application logic communicates with infrastructure through ports.

---

### Infrastructure Layer

Contains technical implementations:

* JPA entities
* Repository adapters
* Database mappings
* External integrations

Infrastructure depends on the domain, not the other way around.

---

## Current Features

### Catalog Module

Implemented:

* Product model
* Variant model
* Product retrieval
* Variant retrieval
* Persistence mapping

---

### Cart Module

Implemented:

* Cart aggregate
* Cart items
* Cart ownership model
* Cart repository port
* JPA persistence adapter
* Add item workflow
* Cart creation workflow

Current design supports:

* Guest shoppers
* Session-based ownership
* Future customer account linking

---

## Technology Stack

### Backend

* Java 21
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Hibernate ORM
* Spring Modulith
* Maven

### Database

* Oracle Database

### Architecture

* Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
* Clean Architecture
* Hexagonal Architecture
* Modular Monolith

---

## Design Goals

The main goals of this project are:

* Keep business logic independent from frameworks
* Model real commerce concepts using domain objects
* Practice aggregate design and domain boundaries
* Create maintainable modules that can evolve independently
* Explore enterprise-level Spring Boot architecture patterns

---

## Running Locally

### Requirements

* Java 21+
* Maven
* Oracle Database (or compatible database configuration)

---

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShlopApp.git

cd ShlopApp
```

---

### Configure Database

Update:

```
src/main/resources/application.properties
```

with your local database configuration.

Example:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=your_database_url
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

---

### Run Application

Using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

or:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

## Future Roadmap

Planned improvements:

* Authentication and authorization
* Session-based guest carts
* Cart expiration
* Customer accounts
* Order management
* Payment integration
* Inventory management
* Event-driven communication between modules
* Automated testing

---

## Project Status

🚧 Active development

ShlopApp is continuously evolving as new domain concepts and architectural improvements are introduced.
